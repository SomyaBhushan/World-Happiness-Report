# World-Happiness-Report 
The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It contains articles, and rankings of national happiness 									
based on respondent ratings of their own lives.Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder(Happiness score), with the best possible life for them 									
being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.The report correlates the results with various life factors such 									
as GDP per Capita, Social Support, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity and Perception of Corruption. Each factor measured reveals a populated-weighted average score that is tracked 									
over time and compared against other countries.
